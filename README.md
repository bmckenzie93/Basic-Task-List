# Basic-Task-List
from Udemy: Traversey Media - Modern JavaScript From The Beginning

  I used materialize, jquery, and font awesome to style the UI for this project. It was super fast and easy.

  To add a task (li) to the task list (ul) I had to create one and inject it in there with its class names and all that. 

  My internet is getting mad slow so i'm going to work on wild water world.

  I was able to write code to clear all of the tasks and remove a single task just now without any assistance. 

  While learning how to filter the tasks I had to look up what indexOf() does, and it will give you the first occurance of whatever you search's index number. I guess if it is true it returns a 1 and if false it returns a -1 or something like that.

  I finished the project, now I will try and implement local storage into my wild water world portfolio project. I got a bit confused by the part when I have to splice an index of the local storage array, I look forward to thinking about it again on my personal project.

  This was a great lesson on javascript!
